            <p>About PokerBaazi:</p>
            <p>Established in 2014, PokerBaazi.com is the brainchild and a trend-setting online venture of Baazi Games, a disruptive entity in India&rsquo;s nascent online gaming industry. The latter has a proven track record of providing excellent online gaming experience over past several years, and it offers its services through online fantasy leagues and other popular sports ventures.</p>
            <p>PokerBaazi.com&nbsp;respects and projects Poker as a skill-based game, and serves its popular online variants in the same regard.<br /> Poker endows its players with several commendable skills like sharper insight into human psychology, reverse psychology, decision making and risk and money management. It also helps you see a situation from the opponent&rsquo;s perspective, take real-time crucial decisions and to keep your emotions at bay when you are at work. Poker completely props the fact that it is not the cards and odds that you play against, it is your psyche and self-belief that you play with. That is exactly how you win at poker (or even at life) when you play your best, no matter what odds are stacked against you.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Our Review:</p>
            <p>The Good</p>
            <p>As mentioned above, PokerBaazi has many different games, that if you don&rsquo;t find it here, you probably won&rsquo;t find on any other online Poker site. Apart from the huge variety of Cash Games with one of the largest active player base, PokerBaazi boasts of conducting the first 1 Crore GTD (The MoneyMaker), 2 Crore GTD (The Game Changer) and 5 Crore GTD (The Endboss) tournaments in the Indian Online Poker circuit.</p>
            <p>Also, PokerBaazi hosts its flagship Tourney series, the Pokerbaazi Premier League (PPL) thrice every year. It has been steadily growing in Guarantees over every edition and the latest one will boast of a 7.3+ Crore GTD Prize pool.</p>
            <p>The Parent company, Baazi Games, has also ventured in the fantasy cricket scene with its own offering by the name of BalleBaazi. They also have a separate platform to host Rummy games for real money, named RummyBaazi.</p>
            <p>The Bad</p>
            <p>The desktop software is completely made in house, which is a bold step in our view but it has its share of bugs and glitches, which are a big turn off for many players who flock to play online poker on PokerBaazi religiously.</p>
            <p>The desktop poker client gets updated daily, sometimes more than once a day and takes a few minutes to load which is quite frustrating to see on a daily basis.</p>
            <p>Pokerbaazi doesn&rsquo;t have a dedicated app for iPad which can be troublesome for some players.</p>
            <p>We found that OFC tables run only on the mobile client and not on the desktop one, which frankly makes PokerBaazi lag way behind their competitors.</p>
            <p>Pokerbaazi also adds a separate GST on top of the rake charged in cash games. In an already tough secluded Indian poker field, where the government takes a massive chunk in 30% TDS charges, players finding it difficult to just break even, these petty charges do nothing to benefit the average online poker enthusiast.</p>
            <p>The Bottom Line</p>
            <p>In Summary, we can say that PokerBaazi is definitely a great site for players of all statures and bankrolls. It has enough action across all stakes for both Hold&rsquo;Em and PLO Players.</p>
            <p>Tournament action is Especially good with massive daily flagships and monthly Micro (The Grinders Series) and value series (PMVS). The PokerBaazi Premier League coupled with The MoneyMaker 1 Cr GTD rounds up for one of the best tourney series throughout the year.</p>
            <p>PokerBaazi has conducted India&rsquo;s largest field Flagship tournament, have one of the best rewards program, and offer the largest cash game leader board ever from an online poker site. If only they somehow work out the bugs and glitches and decrease the rake being charged, they will truly annihilate their competition.</p>
